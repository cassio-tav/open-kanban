# open-kanban

A simple open-source kanban board with a history and the possibility of periodic reports, built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

**The project has been moved to GitLab â€” check it out: [cassio-tav/open-kanban](https://gitlab.com/cassio-tav/open-kanban).
